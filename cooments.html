        <h3>Comments in HTML</h3>
        <p>HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.
            With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code.
        </p>
        <p>Comments are added in the following way:
            <pre>
            &lt!-- Comment in HTML--&gt
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors.
